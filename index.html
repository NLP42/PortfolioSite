              <h3> I'm Natasha.  </h3>
              <p> I live in Tacoma, Washington. <br><br>
              I'm working toward a new career in software engineering or full-stack web development. 
              <br>I've always enjoyed technology and the internet, so this was a natural next step for me. </p>

            <h2> About Me </h2>
           
          <h3> I'm currently learning software engineering and web development </h3>
          <p> I'm doing a bootcamp! I've had a life-long interest in technology, so now I'm making it official. <br>
          Web development is an area that touches the life of practically every person, every day. 
              <br> It's a field where the options are endless. In an era where every company is now an "online" company, 
            and such a large portion of socializing is done via the internet,
            web developers and software engineers play a major and constant role in creating and maintaining these connections. <br>
            I look forward to working with diverse groups of individuals to help shape the way that people interact with the online world.</p>
            <p> I am excited for my next adventure, and can't wait to meet new potential collaborators!</p>
          <br>

          <h3> My background </h3>
         
            <ul>
              <li> BA in Biological Psychology from New College of Florida </li>
              <li> MS in Animal Science from Cornell University</li>
              <li> Sheep lambing management </li>
              <li> Small farms, livestock, food production
                <li> Teaching and research
              <li> Currently: co-running a motorcycle and scooter business </li>
              </ul>  

          <h3> My interests </h3>
          
          <p> I enjoy spending time outside - hiking, biking, rollerskating, kayaking, snowshoeing, and more. When it's too cold and rainy, I like to curl up with a "cozy" videogame, work on art projects, cook (locally grown food!), and spend time with my pets.
